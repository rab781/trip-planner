## 2026-05-01 - [Budget Summary Accessibility]
**Learning:** Adding accessibility to collapsible summary sections in React components requires standard WAI-ARIA disclosure attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` on the button, and matching `id` on the content). It also requires using the `useId()` hook to generate unique DOM IDs and prevent collisions across multiple instances of the component.
**Action:** Apply this WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern with `useId()` consistently whenever implementing accordion-style or collapsible UI elements to ensure they are accessible.
## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility for Absolute Positioned Floating Action Buttons
**Learning:** Absolute positioned floating action buttons (FABs) that act as toggles (like the chatbot toggle) require explicit state and target mapping (`aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`) to be properly understood by screen readers, along with visible focus styles for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always include `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and visible focus rings (e.g., `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2`) on absolute positioned FABs or icon-only controls in the design system.

## 2026-05-26 - Add aria-controls to collapsible sections
**Learning:** React elements with conditionally rendered content blocks based on an `isExpanded` state must be linked for screen readers. Using `aria-expanded` is insufficient without an `aria-controls` attribute linking the toggle button to the container's ID.
**Action:** Always generate a unique ID using `useId()` and link the collapsible toggle button (`aria-controls`) to the conditionally rendered content block (`id`).
