## 2026-05-01 - [Budget Summary Accessibility]
**Learning:** Adding accessibility to collapsible summary sections in React components requires standard WAI-ARIA disclosure attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` on the button, and matching `id` on the content). It also requires using the `useId()` hook to generate unique DOM IDs and prevent collisions across multiple instances of the component.
**Action:** Apply this WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern with `useId()` consistently whenever implementing accordion-style or collapsible UI elements to ensure they are accessible.
## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility for Absolute Positioned Floating Action Buttons
**Learning:** Absolute positioned floating action buttons (FABs) that act as toggles (like the chatbot toggle) require explicit state and target mapping (`aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`) to be properly understood by screen readers, along with visible focus styles for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always include `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and visible focus rings (e.g., `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2`) on absolute positioned FABs or icon-only controls in the design system.

## 2026-06-14 - Dynamic Filter Panel Accessibility
**Learning:** Discovered that dynamic toggle panels (like the filter sidebar on the Map page) were missing critical ARIA attributes to communicate their state and target area to screen readers.
**Action:** Always add `aria-expanded={isOpen}` and `aria-controls="[panel-id]"` to the toggle button, and `id="[panel-id]"` to the dynamically rendered panel container.

## 2026-06-27 - Added aria-pressed to active view toggles
**Learning:** When implementing view toggle buttons (e.g., switching between 'map' and 'list' views) that rely on visual styling to indicate the active state, users relying on assistive technologies cannot easily perceive the selected state.
**Action:** Always include the `aria-pressed={condition}` attribute to convey the selected state to screen readers.
